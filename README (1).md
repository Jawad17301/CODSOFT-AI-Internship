# CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Intership Sep 2023:

Hello!

I'm excited to present this project to you. In this repository, you'll find the culmination of my hard work and dedication. This project focuses on three key tasks:

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: I have implemented a simple chatbot capable of responding to user inputs using if-else statements and pattern matching techniques. This project allowed me to delve into the world of natural language processing and conversation flow.

𝗧𝗶𝗰-𝗧𝗮𝗰-𝗧𝗼𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁: I created an AI player for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It utilizes algorithms like Minimax (and optionally, Alpha-Beta Pruning) to provide an unbeatable challenge to human players. This project was a fantastic opportunity to explore game theory and search algorithms.

𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: Another exciting task was building a recommendation system. It suggests items to users based on their preferences, using techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. This project introduced me to the fascinating field of recommendation algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code within this repository to gain insights into these AI-related tasks. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I hope you find this project informative and engaging!
